# IF ELSE STATEMENTS

```JavaScript
if(condition){
  // do this;
} else {
  // do this;
};
```

##### Setup
- Open `index.html` in Google Chrome
- Open the developers tools console. See the steps below if you forget how to get there:
  - Right click on your webpage in chrome
  - Choose "Inspect"
  - Make sure you on viewing the "Console"
- Look in the `script.js` file. 
  - Add a line in the `script.js` file that says `console.log('Test!')`
- Refresh your page in Chrome. You should see the word Test! in the developer tools console. This means that everything is set up correctly.
- Delete the `console.log('Test!')` now that we know everything is working
